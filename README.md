# Automate Web Accessibility Testing
The goal of SUX (Some User Experience) is to create an automated test for various accessibility APIs out there that measure how accessible a website is.

## What is Web Accessibility?

Web Accessibility means, quite plainly, that everyone who is able to access the web can also navigate and utilize the available resources.

This includes those with limited vision or hearing, as well as those with physical or neurological conditions that may affect their ability to operate a computer or its peripherals.

#### Why Web Accessibility is Important

The internet today offers the possibility of **unprecedented access to information and interaction** for those with disabilities,<sup>[[1]](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php#important)</sup> giving them a freedom and independence that may never have been possible before. The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the web, as a **basic human right**<sup>[[2]](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility/#case)</sup>.

Approximately 20% of the population in the United States have a disability or limitation<sup>[[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0730-us-disability.html)</sup>.

This means that up to 60 million people may have trouble accessing and navigating the web. It is essential that the web be accessible, in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to all users.

Accessibility supports **social inclusion** for people of diverse abilities and those with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

#### What Web Accessibility Looks Like

> There is extensive documentation on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) here at [How to Meet WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).

## Automate Accessibility Testing
The goal of these tests is ______. </br>
Method:</br>
1. Have a few websites (we write our own or copy code from others) that we can use as test inputs.</br>
2. Write regression tests. </br>
* Please read [TestPlan.md](./TestPlan.md)</br>
3. Have those tests be part of our [Jenkins pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started)</br>
